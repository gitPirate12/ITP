# ITP Project: SAP Retail Management System

## First-Time Experience with MERN Stack
This project marked my first experience working with the **MERN stack**. While familiar with JavaScript, I learned how to combine MongoDB for database management, Express for routing, React for the frontend, and Node.js for the server-side logic. I am excited to have gained hands-on experience in developing a full-stack application using these technologies.

## Instructions to Run the App Locally

Follow these steps to run the app on your local machine:

### Installing Packages
Before running the project, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ITPM-LINGO/backend
    ```

3. Install server-side dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Navigate to the client directory:
    ```bash
    cd ITPM-LINGO/frontend
    ```

5. Install client-side dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

### Running the Project
After installing the necessary packages, you can run the project with the following commands:

1. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

2. Start the client:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

By default, the server runs on port 5000 and the client runs on port 3000. Ensure that MongoDB is running on your system.
